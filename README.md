## Overview

Wednesday Golf Club is a personal project meant to help my friends and I with tracking our golf scores. While there are plenty of apps out there already, we wanted something personalized to us. That includes features like an AI heckler, a hot dog counter, and automatic 2 stroke penalties added to everyone else except me....

Wednesday Golf Club is a Progressive Web Application built with NextJS and styled with TailwindCSS. Drizzle is used as a handy ORM with a nice prisma like studio for exploring the database.
